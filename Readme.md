# Trace Link Detection
Software systems must follow the requirements established during development, which can span multiple levels and have complex interdependencies. Manually establishing and maintaining traceability links between requirements can be time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. To address these issues, developers can use trace-link detection tools that automate the process, lowering costs and improving accuracy. This project uses keyword-based information retrieval techniques and natural language processing, such as morphological analysis with a stemmer, to extract meaningful information from requirements documents. Tools based on the Vector Space Model approach with different thresholds are then developed to generate implicit traceability links.
