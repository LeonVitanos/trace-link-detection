# Trace Link Detection
Software systems should always adhere to requirements formulated during the development. These requirements often belong to different levels and requirements of one level are linked to requirements of another level. Software systems can have numerous requirements and links, which consequently makes the system more complex. Establishing and maintaining traceability links in complex systems manually, can be time intensive, error prone, and costly as a result. Automation can alleviate this process and thus lower the costs. Hence, developers and maintainers of the software system can benefit from trace-link detection tools.

The approach for traceability management used in this project is the generation of implicit traceability links using keyword-based information retrieval techniques for link mining in the requirements document. We first eliminated misunderstandings and ambiguities from the requirements in order to extract meaningful information, by using natural language processing techniques, like morphological analysis using a stemmer. We then developed tools based on the Vector Space Model (VSM) approach, using different thresholds.
